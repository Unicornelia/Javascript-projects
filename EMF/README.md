## Synopsis

This folder contains 3 fun tasks that were coded by groups during the last EMF camp 2016. The workshop was exploring the options with real time web. (Realtime Web By: Ben Foxall)
The website we used: https://www.cojs.co

## Workshop details

Workshop was held at EMF camp, Sunday around 2pm.
"We’ll cover a number of ways that we can use realtime data in a webpage, looking at XHR Polling, Server Sent Events, Websockets & Push Notifications - seeing the capabilities of each approach, and how to utilise them in a browser.

This workshop will be code-together; you’ll need a laptop or tablet with a web browser installed.  We’ll use a web based IDE to code along (or, automatically sync if you want to observe instead).

We’ll create things like:
* an animated & synchronised rainbow of colours across our devices
* a virtual flock of birds flying through the room
* a musical instrument that spans across all of our laptops/phones/tablets
* a rudimentary sensor network using our devices to gather data

You’ll leave with a better knowledge of realtime web technologies, the things you can do by combining devices, and have everything you need to create your own multi-device interactions."

## Tasks
# task1
Each of the task does something else when the laptops are connected to eachother. Task 1 is letting participants to change a colour to their favourite and the program will alternate between all these colours, in real time.
# task2
A "yo" line will move around on the screen.
# task3
Play your own music, aka set the tone to a number and watch what happens.

None of these are my only single work, it was all teamwork, people love working together, look how effective this turned out to be. And sharing is caring. Have fun!
